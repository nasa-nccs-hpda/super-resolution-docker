# Business Case Model - Model Survey

Set of questions that will guide you through decision making scenarios for the success of your AI/ML project.
This survey should be the first line of formal communication between all stakeholders. The idea is for this
survey to be a guide and not to limit the creative freedom of the project.

## Survey

Designed as a set of 10 questions to guide initial meeting and or proposal communications addressing all four
core AI/ML elements: Planning, Data, Modeling, and Operations.

### Planning

- What scientific problem would you like to answer?
- What computational method have you considered to employ? (e.g. regression, object detection, image classification,
semantic segmentation, clustering, anomaly detection, etc.)

### Data

- Describe the available data: source, location, size, resolution, licensing, any training data, etc.
- What is the raw data format? Any preprocessing required to make the raw data usable? (not related to individual AI/ML algorithms
preprocessing)
- What features in the data would you like to identify/address to answer the scientific problem? (e.g. trees, signal anomalies,
autonomous decisions)

### Modeling

- Are you limited to use a particular AI/ML algorithm?
- Is part of the project the comparison of different algorithms to solve the scientific problem in question? Any interests
in performance benchmarking and optimization?

### Operations

- Do you have enough computational resources for your problem needs? (e.g. GPUS, CPUS, TPUs, etc.)
- Do you need to leverage on-premises or cloud resources? Describe any limitations and/or estimated number of computing hours if available.
- Describe how the final product should look like, in particular: size, format, accessibility, static (one time only)
or dynamic (generated per request), time requirements, etc.

### Additional Questions

- What is the timeline and funding of the project?
- Any external collaborations?
- Any training required before starting the project?
